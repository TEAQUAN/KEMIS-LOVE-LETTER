      <h1>Dear KEMI MY ANGELü™Ω</h1>
      <p class="note">
        I write to you not just to tell you how much you mean to me, but to express the depth of the feelings I have for you. Even though we‚Äôve known each other for a short time, what I feel for you is stronger than anything I‚Äôve ever felt for people I‚Äôve known much longer.
        You are the prettiest and the most beautiful woman I know both inside and out. Some days you don't feel like you are, but to me, you are. The way you care about me and always want to be around me, calling me all that means a lot to me. You always reassure me even though you don't need to. I feel so comfortable around you that I know you won't judge me‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I can tell you anything.
        I still remember the first day I texted you. Honestly, I thought you might ignore me, but you didn‚Äôt. You responded, and from that moment, something special started between us‚Äîa connection I never expected, but one that I am so grateful for, and my prayer is it never ends. I want to be with you for life. I love you so much, babe‚ù§Ô∏èüíû.
        The more we get to know each other, the deeper my feelings grow. You make my heart smile, and I find myself thinking about you more than I ever imagined. Every moment with you feels so special, and I can‚Äôt help but look forward to the beautiful memories we will create together.
        You feel like you are not girlfriend material, but you are. These other dudes don't know what they had and they lost it, but we thank God sha, because if they did, we won‚Äôt be where we are. 
        I know you have your doubts about us, but I promise you there is nothing to be worried about.
        I want this journey to last forever, to stand by your side through every high and low. You have brought so much joy into my life, and I can imagine a future with you in it. I love you more than words could ever truly express, and I hope this letter comes close to showing just how much you mean to me.
      </p>
